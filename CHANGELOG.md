* Modified the auto generated tasks in tasks.json to generate full paths and disable summary to fix the problem of no source links in the problems panel. (PR:[#3145](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/3145))
* Added support for Roslyn code actions that normally need UI - they used to be explicitly sipped by OmniSharp, now it surfaces them with predefined defaults instead. ([omnisharp-roslyn#1220](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1220), PR: [#1406](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1406)) These are:
  * extract interface
  * generate constructor
  * generate overrides
  * generate *Equals* and *GetHashCode*
* Improved analyzers performance by introducing background analysis support ([omnisharp-roslyn#1507](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1507))
* According to [official Microsoft .NET Core support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core), .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 (`project.json`-based .NET Core flavors) have reached end of life and went out of support on 27 June 2019. OmniSharp features to support that, which have been obsolete and disabled by default since version 1.32.2 (2018-08-07), are now completely removed.
* Fixed a bug where some internal services didn't respect the disabling of a project system ([omnisharp-roslyn#1543](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1543))
* Improved the MSBuild selection logic. The standalone instance inside OmniSharp is now preferred over VS2017, with VS2019 given the highest priority. This ensures that .NET Core 3.0 works correctly. It is also possible manually provide an MSBuild path using OmniSharp configuration, which is then always selected. ([omnisharp-roslyn#1541](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1541), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1545](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1545))
    ```JSON
        {
            "MSBuild": {
                "MSBuildOverride": {
                    "MSBuildPath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin",
                    "Name": "vs2017 msbuild"
                }
            }
        }
    ```
* Added support for *AdditionalFiles* in csproj files ([omnisharp-roslyn#1510](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1510), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1547](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1547))
* Fixed a bug in *.editorconfig* where formatting settings were not correctly passed into external code fixes ([omnisharp-roslyn#1558](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1558), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1559](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1559))


## 1.20.0 (June 11, 2019)

* Updated the auto-generated launch.json to use new mechanism for starting web browser. For more information: https://aka.ms/VSCode-CS-LaunchJson-WebBrowser
* Improved support for .NET Core 3
* Updates to Razor support
* Made QuickInfo display more consistent with Visual Studio. ([#2610](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2610))  (_Contributed by_ [@paladique](https://github.com/paladique)) (PR: [#3090](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/3090/))
* Added support for fading unnecessary code and using statements [#2873](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2873)

## 1.19.1 (May 6, 2019)

* Updated debugger to work correctly on Linux distributions with openssl 1.1 such as Ubuntu 19.04 ([#3010](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/3010))
* Fixed OmniSharp hanging on wildcard Nuget package references. (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1473](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1473))
* OmniSharp now uses correct 4.7.2 framework sku to prompt for installation of .NET 4.7.2 if missing. (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1469](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1469)).

## 1.19.0 (April 16, 2019)
* Improved support for .NET Core 3
* Added support for roslyn analyzers, code fixes and rulesets which can be enabled via`omnisharp.enableRoslynAnalyzers` setting.
* Improved Razor diagnostics
* Razor tooling support for tag helpers

## 1.18.0 (March 26, 2019)

* Added a `csharp.maxProjectFileCountForDiagnosticAnalysis` setting to configure the file limit when the extension stops reporting errors for whole workspace. When this threshold is reached, the diagnostics are reported for currently opened files only. This mechanism was available in previous versions, but now can be configured. The default is 1000. (PR: [#1877](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1877))
* Added a `omnisharp.enableMsBuildLoadProjectsOnDemand` setting to load project for files that were opened in the editor. This setting is useful for big C# codebases and allows for faster initialization of code navigation features only for projects that are relevant to code that is being edited._(Contributed by [@dmgonch](https://github.com/dmgonch)) (PR: [#2750](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2750/files))
* Added initial support for C# 8. (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1365](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1365))
* Fixed finding references to operator overloads _(Contributed by [@SirIntruder](https://github.com/SirIntruder))_ (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1371](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1371))
* Improved handling of files moving on disk (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1368](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1368))
* Improved detection of MSBuild when multiple instances are available _(Contributed by [@johnnyasantoss ](https://github.com/johnnyasantoss))_ (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1349](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1349))
* Fixed a bug where the "OmniSharp" and "C# log" would steal the editor focus and hinder the user's development flow. (PR: [#2828](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2828))
* Improvement in code load times for the extension by using webpack (PR: [#2835](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2835))
* Added tasks for "dotnet publish" and "dotnet watch" in the initial asset generation  _(Contributed by [@timheuer ](https://github.com/timheuer))_ (PR: [#2903](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2903))

#### Debugger
* Added support for set next statement. Set next statement is a feature that has been available for a long time in full Visual Studio, and this brings the feature to Visual Studio Code. This feature allows developers to change what code is executed next in the target program. For example, you can move the instruction pointer back to re-execute a function that you just ran so you can debug into it, or you can skip over some code that you don't want to execute. To use this feature, move your cursor to the statement you would like to execute next, and either open the editor context menu and invoke 'Set Next Statement (.NET)', or use the keyboard shortcut of <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F10</kbd> ([#1753](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1753))
* Improved responsiveness by making the debugger backend asynchronous and cancelable so that operations (ex: evaluate expression 'xyz') can be aborted on step/go/disconnect ([#1215](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1215)).
* Added support for pagination of evaluation result children. Before, if an element in the watch/variables/data tip had a large number of child elements, then the first 1,000 children would be calculated up front and no others would be shown. This could be very slow. Now only the first 25 elements are calculated and there is a '\[More]' node to obtain additional values. Note that if you are trying to find a particular element in a large collection it is still best to use Linq (example: `myCollection.Where(x => x > 12).ToList()`).
* Added support for showing return values in the variables window ([#859](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/859)).
* Fixed evaluating string functions with interpretation in .NET Core 2.1+. Evaluation uses interpretation for conditional breakpoints, evaluating methods that take a lambda, etc ([#2683](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2683)).
* Many small improvements to launch.json/tasks.json generation. Highlights include a selection dialog if the workspace contains multiple launchable projects, a few simplifications to reduce the number of fields in the default launch.json, and switching the 'problem matcher' for build tasks. (PR: [#2780](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2780))
* Updated the default symbol cache directory to match other .NET Tools ([#2797](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2797)).

## 1.17.1 (November 11, 2018)

* Updated Razor language service to fix various Razor editing reliability issues. For details see https://github.com/aspnet/Razor.VSCode/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha2.

## 1.17.0 (October 31, 2018)

* Added preview Razor (cshtml) language service with support for C# completions and diagnostics in ASP.NET Core projects. Please report issues with the preview Razor tooling on the [aspnet/Razor.VSCode](https://github.com/aspnet/Razor.VSCode/issues) repo. To disable the preview Razor tooling set the "razor.disabled" setting to `true`. (PR: [2554](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2554))
* Added omnisharp.minFindSymbolsFilterLength setting to configure the number of characters a user must type in for "Go to Symbol in Workspace" command to return any results (default is 0 to preserve existing behavior). Additionally added omnisharp.maxFindSymbolsItems for configuring maximum number of items returned by "Go to Symbol in Workspace" command. The default is 1000. (PR: [#2487](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2487))
* Added a command - "CSharp: Start authoring a new issue on GitHub" to enable the users to file issues on github from within the extension with helpful config information from their system. (PR: [#2503](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2503))

#### Debugger
* Fixed crash at the end of debug sessions on Linux ([#2439](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2439))
* Fixed searching for PDBs in original built location ([#2483](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2483))
* Fixed launching the web browser against an ASP.NET project that uses wildcard ('*') bindings ([#2528](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2528))

## 1.16.2 (October 3, 2018)
* Update extension to handle upcoming breaking change to launch.json configurations in VS Code 1.28. (PR: [#2558](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2558))
* Fixed a bug where OmniSharp flame was red in spite of OmniSharp loading the projects without any errors. (PR: [#2450](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2540))
* Fixed launch.json `envFile` option on Windows. (PR: [#2560](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2560))
* Fixed a problem with tracking virtual documents from other providers. (PR: [#2562](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2562))

## 1.16.0 (September 10, 2018)

#### Project System

* Separated the existing "Restore Packages" option in the Command Palette into two distinct functions:
  * "Restore Project" - Displays a drop-down that shows all the available projects in the solution or in the workspace. Selecting one of them would trigger a dotnet restore for the particular project.
  * "Restore All Projects" - Triggers a dotnet restore for all projects in the current solution or workspace.

* Modified the "Unresolved dependencies" prompt to restore the all the projects in the currently selected solution or workspace. (PR: [#2323](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2323))

* Added support to configure the default *.sln file loaded when opening a project with multiple *.sln files in the root. _(Contributed by [@janaka](https://github.com/janaka))_ (PR: [#2053](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2053))

* Added support for tracking opening, closing and changing of virtual documents that don't exist on disk. (PR: [#2436](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2436)) _(Contributed by [@NTaylorMullen](https://github.com/NTaylorMullen))_

* Enabled IDE features for .cs files that are not part of a project. (PR: [#2471](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2471), [omnisharp-roslyn#1252](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1252))

#### Misc

* Added a prompt to "Restart OmniSharp" when there is a change in omnisharp "path", "useGlobalMono" or "waitForDebugger" settings. (PR: [#2316](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2316))

#### Editor

* Improved diagnostics by refreshing them when the active editor changes or the current window is focused. (PR: [#2317](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2317)) _(Contributed by [@SirIntruder](https://github.com/SirIntruder))_

* Improved completions by adding the preselect property so the best match is preselected. (PR: [#2388](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2388))

#### Testing

* Added test execution output to the output of the Run/Debug Test CodeLens. (PR: [#2337](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2337), [#2343](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2343), [omnisharp-roslyn#1203](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1203))
* Fixed a bug where a debug session could not be started and duplicate logs were displayed after a previous one failed due to build failure. (PR: [#2405](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2405), [omnisharp-roslyn#1239](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1239))

#### Options

* Added `monoPath` option to use the mono installation at the specified path when the `useGlobalMono` is set to "always" or "auto". (PR: [#2425](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2425)) _(Contributed by [@shana](https://github.com/shana))_

#### Debugger

* Added support for launching with environment variables stored in a seperate file from launch.json via a new `envFile` option. (PR: [#2462](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2462), [#1944](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1944)) _(Contributed by [@SebastianPfliegel](https://github.com/SebastianPfliegel))_
* Fixed editting breakpoint conditions while debugging with recent versions of VS Code. ([#2428](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2428))
* Added support for hit count breakpoint conditions. ([#895](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/895))
* Support the `applicationUrl` property in launchSettings.json. ([#2296](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2296))
* Improve the error message when attaching to privileged processes on Linux and macOS. ([#477](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/477))

## 1.15.2 (May 15, 1018)

* Fixed a 1.30.0 regression that prevented the script project system from working on Unix-based systems ([omnisharp-roslyn#1184](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1184), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1185](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1185)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* Fixed a regression that could cause the debugger to crash on Windows ([#2297](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2297)).

## 1.15.1 (May 11, 1018)

* The minimum Mono version required to run OmniSharp on has been increased to 5.8.1.

## 1.15.0 (May 10, 2018)

#### Debugger

* New features:

  * Adds support for [Source Link](https://aka.ms/SourceLinkSpec), Symbol Servers and other more advanced symbol options ([#373](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/373))
  * Adds launch.json option to suppress Just-In-Time compiler optimizations.
  * Due to the previous two items and work from the .NET Team, it is now possible to easily debug into ASP.NET itself in projects running against .NET Core 2.1. Instructions are in the [wiki](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Debugging-into-the-.NET-Framework-itself).
  * Adds support for pulling in environment variables from `${cwd}/Properties/launchSettings.json`. This means that if you add environment variable configuration to your launchSettings.json file, they will now be used when you start your app from Visual Studio Code like they previously would be used from the command line (`dotnet run`), and from Visual Studio. ([#2017](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2017))

* Bug fixes:

  * On Linux, this reduces the native dependencies of the debugger to match the .NET Core 2.1 runtime. The Linux .NET Core 2.1 runtime reduced its native dependencies over all the previous versions, but the debugger still had the same dependencies as .NET Core 2.0. With this fix, the debugger will now continue to work on Linux after installing the .NET Core runtime and nothing else. ([#2199](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2199))
  * Fixes async call stacks with the .NET Core 2.1 runtime. ([#1892](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1892))
  * Fixes the debugger's browser launch code when launching projects configured to use Application Insights. ([2177](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2177))

#### Editor

* Fixed regression where the "Generate Type in New File" code action would create an empty file. ([#2112](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2112), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1143](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1143))
* Made several improvements to the display of tooltips in Signature Help. ([#1940](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1940), PR: [#1958](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1958))

#### Options

* "omnisharp.path": This option has been updated to enable the user to specify different versions of OmniSharp, including prerelease versions. ([#1909](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1909), PR: [#2039](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2039))

  Possible values for this option are:
  * `<Path to the omnisharp executable>`: Use a local copy of OmniSharp. The value must point directly to the OmniSharp executable. This is typically the build output directory of the [omnisharp-roslyn](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn) project on the current machine, for example, `C:/omnisharp-roslyn/artifacts/publish/OmniSharp.Stdio/win7-x64/OmniSharp.exe`.
  * `latest`: Use the latest CI build from [omnisharp-roslyn](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).
  * `<version>`: Use a specific version of OmniSharp. Example: `1.29.2-beta.60`
  If "omnisharp.path" is not set, the defalut version of OmniSharp for the current release of C# for VS Code is used.

* "omnisharp.useGlobalMono": This option replaces the old "omnisharp.useMono" option and controls whether or not OmniSharp will be launched with a globally-installed version of Mono. (PR: [#2244](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2244))

  There are three possible values:
  * "auto": Automatically launch OmniSharp with `mono` if version 5.2.0 or greater is available on the PATH.
  * "always": Always launch OmniSharp with `mono`. If version 5.2.0 or greater is not available on the PATH, an error will be printed.
  * "never": Never launch OmniSharp on a globally-installed Mono.

* It is now possible to suppress the "Some projects have trouble loading" popup using the `omnisharp.disableMSBuildDiagnosticWarning` option. ([#2110](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2110)

#### Project System

* Several common globbing patterns are now excluded by default when OmniSharp scans for `*.csproj`, `*.cake`, or `*.csx` files to load. The deafault patterns are `**/node_modules/**/*`, `**/bin/**/*`, `**/obj/**/*`, `**/.git/**/*`. ([omnisharp-roslyn#896](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/896), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1161](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1161)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* The list of globbing patterns that are excluded by OmniSharp can be customized in an `omnisharp.json` file list so.
  ```JSON
  {
    "systemExcludeSearchPatterns": [
      "**/test/**/*"
    ],
    "excludeSearchPatterns": [
      "**/local/**/*"
    ]
  }
  ```

  For more details on configuring OmniSharp see [Configuration Options](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/wiki/Configuration-Options) at the [omnisharp-roslyn](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn) repo. ([omnisharp-roslyn#896](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/896), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1161](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1161)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* Improved handling of projects with XAML files. ([#2173](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2173), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1157](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1157))
* MSBuild is now properly located on Windows for Visual Studio 2017 previews. ([omnisharp-roslyn#1166](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1166)) _(Contributed by [@rainersigwald](https://github.com/rainersigwald))_

#### Scripting

* It is now possible to define the default target framework for C# scripts in an `omnisharp.json` file.

  ```JSON
  {
    "script": {
      "defaultTargetFramework": "netcoreapp2.0"
    }
  }
  ```

  (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1154](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1154)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_

#### Status Bar

* Splits the OmniSharp status bar item into two parts, both of which appear on the left side of VS Code's status bar and have specific responsibilities. ([#2146](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2146), PR: [#2133](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2133))

  * OmniSharp Server info:
    * Displays the current state of the  OmniSharp server, such as Downloading, Installing, etc. The flame icon is green when the server is initialized and running properly, or red if there is an error.
  * Selected Project info:
    * Displays the name of the selected project regardless of the currently active document.
    * If a project is already selected, it displays the name of the selected project. Clicking on it displays a menu to switch to other projects in the workspace.
    * If there are multiple possible launch targets, it displays 'Select Project'. Clicking on it displays a menu to select one.

#### Testing

* Added "debug all tests" and "run all tests" to the CodeLens that appears above test classes to allow running or debugging all tests in a class. ([#420](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/420), PRs: [#1961](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1961), [omnisharp-roslyn#1089](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1089)

#### Misc

* Fixed script for creating offline VSIXs. ([#2137](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2137), PR: [#2138](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/2138))

* Adds support for extracting source files embedded in PDBs. See the C# [EmbeddedFiles](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/19127) feature for more information.
* Adds preliminary support for Linux ARM debugging

#### Editor

* Fix to allow signature help return results for attribute constructors. ([#1814](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1814), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1007](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1007))
* Fix to return correct SymbolKinds from WorkspaceSymbolprovider ([#1907](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1907), PR: [#1911](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1911)) _(Contributed by [@craig006](https://github.com/craig006))_

#### Task Generation

* Updated task generator to match latest schema from VS Code (PR: [#1932](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1923)) _(Contributed by [@natec425](https://github.com/natec425))_
* Fixed a typo in tasks.json (PR: [1945](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1945)) _(Contributed by [@SebastianPfliegel](SebastianPfliegel))_

#### Misc

* Fixed offline packaging ([1912](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1912), [1930](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1930), PR: [#1931](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1931))

## 1.13.1 (November 13, 2017)

* Addressed problem with Sdk-style projects not being loaded properly in certain cases. ([#1846](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1846), [#1849](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1849), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1021](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1021))
* Fixed issue with discovering MSBuild under Mono even when it is missing. ([omnisharp-roslyn#1011](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1011), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1016](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1016))

## 1.13.0 (November 7, 2017)

#### Cake

* Added support for *.cake files! (PRs: [#1681](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1681), [omnisharp-roslyn#932](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/932)) _(Contributed by [@mholo65](https://github.com/mholo65))_

#### Debugger

* Improved logic for resolving breakpoints in local functions and lambdas. ([#1678](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1678))
* When generating a new launch.json file via "start debugging" in a workspace without a launch.json file, the extension now provides the same content as is created with the '.NET: Generate Assets for Build and Debug' command. This takes advantage of a new extensibility point from VS Code. Before the C# extension could only statically provide templates, so, for example, they couldn't have the path to the launchable project. (PR: [#1801](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1801))

#### Editor

* Improved completion list behavior when matching substrings. (PRs: [#1813](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1813), [omnisharp-roslyn#990](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/990)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* Completion list now triggers on SPACE after `new`. ([#146](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/146), PR: [#1776](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1776), [omnisharp-roslyn#975](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/975))

* Improved symbol search behavior when matching substrings. (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#990](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/990)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_

#### Project System

* Significantly changed how MSBuild is located by OmniSharp, resulting in more project types loading properly. (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#988](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/988))
* Fixed bug where `LangVersion` property was not read correctly from project file, blocking C# 7.1 development. ([omnisharp-roslyn#961](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/961), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#962](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/962)]) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* Fixed issue where signing key was not read correctly from project file, which can result in InternalsVisibleTo not being handled properly. (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#964](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/964))
* Fixed long-standing problem with renaming files. ([#785](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/785), [#1792](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1792), PR: [#1805](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1805))
* Fixed problem where the Antlr4.CodeGenerator Nuget package would not generate files during OmniSharp design-time build. ([#1822](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1822), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1002](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1002))
* Fixed issue where a C# project referencing a non-C# project would cause the referenced project to be loaded (causing OmniSharp to potentially treat it as C#!). ([#371](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/371), [#1829](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1829), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#1005](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1005))

#### Testing

* Pass `--no-restore` when invoking `dotnet build` to ensure that implicit restore does not run, making the build and the test run a bit faster. ([omnisharp-roslyn##942](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/942), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#945](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/945))
* Fix Unit Test debugging with VS Code 1.18. ([#1800](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1800))

#### Other Updates and Fixes

* If Mono 5.2.0 or greater is installed, OmniSharp will be launched on that rather than the local Mono runtime that it carries with it. This allows, more Mono and Xamarin projects to load properly and improves OmniSharp performance (since it can run on Mono AOT'd binaries). ([#1779](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1779), PR: [#1789](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1789))
* Support added for launching OmniSharp on folders and solutions across multi-root workspaces. ([#1762](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1762), PR: [#1806](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1806))
* Added `csharp.referencesCodeLens.enabled` and `csharp.testsCodeLens.enabled` options to allow disabling/enabling for the 'references' and 'run/debug test' code lenses independently.

## 1.12.1 (August 14, 2017)

* MSBuild support properly sets CscToolExe to 'csc.exe' to address issues when a project's MSBuild targets have set it to 'mcs.exe'. ([#1707](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1707))

## 1.12.0 (August 8, 2017)

#### Debugger

* Update debugger to run *itself* on .NET Core 2.0-preview2 (target app can still use .NET Core 1.x). This allows the debugger to run on more Linux distributions, and it allows there to be a single debugger package for all supported Linux distributions.
* Fix issue where the call stack may be empty when stepping quickly ([#1575](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1575))
* Improvements to the information displayed in the editor peak window when stopping on an exception that has inner exceptions ([#1007](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1007))
* Fix expression evaluation when stopping at an exception in .NET Core 2.0 ([#1593](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1593))
* Improve error behavior when `"program"` in launch.json is set to a path that doesn't exist ([#1634](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1634))
* Enable stepping by statement (instead of by line) ([#1476](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1476))

#### Editor

* Go to Definition now works from "metadata as source" files ([#771](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/771), PR: [#1620](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1620)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* Selection-based code fixes and refactorings (such as "Extract Method") will no longer be offerred unless there is actually a selection in the editor. ([#1605](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1605), PR: [#1606](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1606))

#### Project System

* Mono targets and tasks are now better located when Mono is installed. This enables support for many Mono-based projects types, such as Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, MonoGame, etc. ([#1597](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1597), [#1624](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1624), [#1396](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1396) [omnisharp-roslyn#892](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/892), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#923](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/923))

* The MSBuild project system now calls the "Compile" target rather than the "ResolveReferences" target when processing MSBuild files. This has the effect of ensuring that other targets have the opportunity to run (such as targets that generate files) while still not building any output binaries. ([#1531](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1531))
* Binding redirects added for MSBuild assemblies, fixing issues with MSBuild tasks built with different versions of MSBuild. ([omnisharp-roslyn#903](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/903))
* The OmniSharp server has updated to the latest MSBuild. ([omnisharp-roslyn#904](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/904), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#907](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/907))

* Added nag message when project.json projects are opened by OmniSharp, to serve as a reminder to migrate projects from project.json to .csproj. (PR: [#1657](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1657))
* Added `type` property to `csharp.unitTestDebuggingOptions` to allow debugging tests with 'clr' debugger (Windows only). ([#1586](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1586), PR: [#1663](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1663))
* The `[csharp]` configuration section is now checked for formatting options. ([#1574](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1574)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* All project systems (project.json, MSBuild, CSX Scripting) now support an "Enabled" property that can be configured in omnisharp.json. (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#902](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/902)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* The OmniSharp server has been updated to Roslyn 2.3.0, which adds support for C# 7.1 (PRs: [omnisharp-roslyn#900](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/900), [omnisharp-roslyn#901](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/901), [omnisharp-roslyn#930](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/930) and [omnisharp-roslyn#931](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/931))

* Fix issue where VS Code would incorrectly display threads as paused ([#1317](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1317))
* Added new 'csharp.fallbackDebuggerLinuxRuntimeId' configuration setting to control the version of the debugger used on Linux ([#1361](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1361)).
* Added a new `clr` debugging `type` in launch.json to enable debugging for Azure scenarios. That type is limited to Windows Desktop CLR, 64-bit processes, and only supports the [Portable PDB debug format](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Portable-PDBs).
* Added support for the launch.json editor's 'Add Configuration' button ([#1024](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1024]))

#### Project System

* Properly handle package references with version ranges in .csproj (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#814](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/814))
* Fix regression with MSBuild project system where a project reference and a binary reference could be added for the same assembly, causing ambiguity errors ([omnisharp-roslyn#795](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/795), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#815](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/815))

#### Improved OmniSharp Settings
* Added support for global omnisharp.json file ([omnisharp-roslyn#717](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/7170), PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#809](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/809)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_

  This file can appear in one of the following locations:
  * Windows: `%APPDATA%\OmniSharp\omnisharp.json`
  * macOS/Linus: `~/.omnisharp/omnisharp.json`
* Watch local and global omnisharp.json files for changes while OmniSharp is running. Currently, this only works for formatting options. (PR: [omnisharp-roslyn#804](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/804))_(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_

#### Scripting

* C# scripts (.csx files) now allow multiple `#load` directives, and `#r` and `#load` directives update live. ([omnisharp-roslyn#760](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/760)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* .csx files can now be discovered as valid launch targets using the project selector at the bottom-right of the status bar. ([#1247](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1247)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* Assembly references will now unify properly for C# scripts. ([omnisharp-roslyn#764](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/764)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* Unsafe code is now allowed in C# scripts. ([omnisharp-roslyn#781](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/781)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* C# scripting now ignores duplicated CorLibrary types, which can manifest in certain edge scenarios. ([omnisharp-roslyn#784](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/784)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_

#### Debugger

The 1.8 release makes a major change to how the debugger works under the hood. This new architecture simplifies how the debugger is tied to VS Code. We hope that this will make it easier to bring .NET debugging features to VS Code. We also expect it to improve debugger launch performance.

Changes:

* The module load messages in the output window are now more detailed and hopefully less confusing. ([#837](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/837))
* Programs can now be launched into VS Code's integrated terminal. ([documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/blob/main/debugger.md#console-terminal-window))
* VS Code recently introduced [column breakpoint support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_10#_column-breakpoints) and they are now enabled for C#.
* React to the VS Code change to use `${command:` instead of `${command.`. ([#1275](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1275))
* Fix a problem with browser launch support that could lead to debugger session's being aborted when the browser is started. ([#1274](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1274))
* Remote debugging breaking changes: as part of our new architecture, there are a few breaking changes to the way remote debugging works.

    * vsdbg vs. clrdbg: As part of the new architecture, clrdbg has been replaced with a new executable named vsdbg. As such, the script to download vsdbg has changed to http://aka.ms/getvsdbgsh. Run `curl -sSL https://aka.ms/getvsdbgsh | bash /dev/stdin -v latest -l ~/vsdbg` to download. See the [wiki](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Attaching-to-remote-processes) for more information.
    * Pseudo-tty's are no longer supported: previously we were a little more tolerant of pseudo-tty's transforming the input/output from the remote debugger. We are currently not as tolerant. If you are using `ssh` or `plink` as a pipe program, pass `-T` to fix this. If you have another transport and you are no longer able to connect, let us know and we can fix this for a future release.
    * `debuggerPath` is now required - previously the `debuggerPath` property of `pipeTransport` was recomended but not required. As part of this change we are now requiring it.

#### Other Updates and Fixes

* Find All References now properly highlights locations of found references. ([#428](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/428))
* Assembly references will now unify properly for project.json projects. ([#1221](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1221))
* Code Actions (i.e. refactorings and fixes) now respect the formatting options that are set when a project is opened. ([omnisharp-roslyn#759](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/759)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_
* Completion support for package references in project.json files has been restored. ([#1236](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/1236))
* The C# TextMate grammar used for syntax highlighting has been removed because it is now part of Visual Studio Code itself. ([#1206](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1206)) _(Many thanks to [@aeschli](https://github.com/aeschli))_

## 1.7.0 (February 8, 2017)

## 1.5.0 (November 14, 2016)

#### Initial support for C# 7

* New C# 7 features like pattern-matching and tuples are now supported in VS Code editor. Note: To use tuples, you will need a reference to [this NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.ValueTuple).

#### Initial support for CSProj .NET Core Projects

* With the .NET Core SDK moving to embrace MSBuild and .csproj files over project.json, we've made sure the C# extension can handle the new format. This support is preliminary and there are still several features coming to smooth out the experience.

#### Broader OS Support for C# Code Editing

* This release dramatically changes the runtime that OmniSharp runs on, which allows it to be run an many more operating systems than before:

  * Windows: OmniSharp runs on the installed .NET Framework. In addition, OmniSharp now runs on 32-bit Windows!
  * macOS/Linux: OmniSharp runs on a custom embedded Mono runtime. Note: Mono does not need to be installed on the system for this to work.

#### Debugger

* Remote debugging is now supported for attach by using the `pipeTransport` launch.json option.
* Resolved issue with setting breakpoints when there are multple files with the same name (e.g. two 'Program.cs' files).

#### New Dependency Acquisition System

* This improves the acquisition and reliability of platform-specific OmniSharp and debugger dependencies.

#### New Settings

Several new settings have been added:

* `csharp.suppressDotnetRestoreNotification`: Suppress the notification window to perform a 'dotnet restore' when dependencies can't be resolved.
* `omnisharp.projectLoadTimeout`: The time Visual Studio Code will wait for the OmniSharp server to start. Time is expressed in seconds. _(Contributed by [@wjk](https://github.com/wjk))_

#### Colorizer

* A new unit testing framework for testing the colorizer grammer ([#742](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/742)) _(Contributed by [@ivanz](https://github.com/ivanz))_
* Single-line comments after preprocessor directives ([#762](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/762)) _(Contributed by [@damieng](https://github.com/damieng))_

#### Performance

* Major improvements have been made to editor performance. The communication with the OmniSharp server has been rewritten to allow long-running operations (such as gathering all errors and warnings) to queue while high priority operations (such as text buffer changes) run serially. ([#902](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/902)) _(Thanks to [@david-driscoll](https://github.com/david-driscoll) for his help with this change!)_

#### Other Improvements

* The prompt to generate assets for building and debugging can now be dismissed for a workspace permanently. In addition, a new `dotnet.generateAssets` command has been added to force regeneration of the assets. ([#635](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/635))
* Fix "running forever" issue for folder with multple .NET Core projects. ([#735](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/735)) _(Contributed by [@eamodio](https://github.com/eamodio))_
* `ctor` snippet is now more consistent with other code snippets. ([#849](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/849)) _(Contibuted by [@Eibx](https://github.com/Eibx))_
* Ampersands in file paths are now properly escaped on Windows ([#909](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/909)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_

## 1.4.1 (September 1, 2016)

* This addresses an issue found and fixed by @sixpindin in which the legacy csharp.omnisharp and csharp.omnisharpUsesMono settings are no longer respected. These settings have been supplanted by the omnisharp.path and omnisharp.useMono settings but are still expected to work if specified.

## 1.4.0 (August 29, 2016)

#### Metadata as Source

* Go to Definition (<kbd>F12</kbd>) can now show a C#-like view for APIs that do not appear in your project's source code. ([#165](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/165))

#### Debugger

* Applications can now be launched without attaching the debugger with <kbd>Ctrl+F5</kbd>.
* Support for new "embedded portable PDB" debug format.
* The launch.json file generator now automatically sets the option to show a console window by default (`"internalConsoleOptions": "openOnSessionStart"`).

#### New Settings

Several new settings have been added:

* `csharp.suppressDotnetInstallWarning`: Suppress the warning that the .NET CLI is not on the path.
* `omnisharp.autoStart`: Used to control whether the OmniSharp server will be automatically launched when a folder containing a project or solution is opened. The default value for this setting is `true`.
* `omnisharp.path`: Can be used to specify a file path to a different OmniSharp server than the one that will be used by default. Previously, this option was controlled by `csharp.omnisharp`, which is now deprecated.
* `omnisharp.useMono`: When `omnisharp.path` is specified, this controls whether OmniSharp will be launched with Mono or not. Previously, this option was controlled by `csharp.omnisharpUsesMono`, wich is now deprecated.
* `omnisharp.loggingLevel`: Used to control the level of logging output from the OmniSharp server. Legal values are `"default"` or `"verbose"`.

#### Colorizer

There have been several fixes to the colorizer grammar resulting in much smoother syntax highlighting, with better support for C# 6.0. Special thanks go to [@ivanz](https://github.com/ivanz) and [@seraku24](https://github.com/seraku24) for contributing most of the fixes below!

* Expression-bodied members ([#638](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/638), [#403](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/403), [#679](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/679), [#249](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/249))
* Escaped keyword identifiers ([#614](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/614))
* Using directives and nested namespaces ([#282](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/282), [#381](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/381))
* Field and local variable type names ([#717](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/717), [#719](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/719))
* Multi-dimensional arrays in parameters ([#657](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/657))

#### Performance

* Improvements have been made in processing diagnostics (i.e. errors and warnings).
* Full solution diagnostics are no longer computed for large solutions (e.g. solutions with >1000 files across all projects). However, diagnostics are still computed for open files.

#### Other Improvements

* Multibyte characters are now properly encoded, resulting in proper display in tooltips and fixing crashes in the OmniSharp server. ([#4](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/4), [#140](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/140), [#427](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/427))
* Will no longer attempt to install a CoreCLR flavor of OmniSharp on Ubuntu versions other than 14 and 16. ([#655](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/655))
* Opening a solution or csproj no longer results in '0 projects' displayed in the status bar. ([#723](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/723))

## 1.3.0 (July 20, 2016)

* Support for Unity and Mono development on macOS and Linux has been restored! This release brings back support for the Mono version of OmniSharp, which is used to provide *much* better support for .csproj/.sln projects. Please note that Mono version 4.0.1 or newer is required.
* Generation of tasks.json and launch.json files can now properly handle nested projects. [#170](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/170)
* New UI that makes it easy to select a process ID when attaching the debugger to another process. Note: If you have an existing launch.json file, you can re-generate it by deleting the file, closing your workspace in Visual Studio Code and opening it again. Or, you can open the launch.json file and change the `processId` value to `"${command:pickProcess}"`.
* Support for debugging in .cshtml files. To enable this, add a `sourceFileMap` entry to your launch.json with the following content: `"sourceFileMap": { "/Views": "${workspaceRoot}/Views" }`
* Support for conditional breakpoints
* New support for changing variable values in the debugger! To try this, just right-click on the variable name and select 'Set Value'. Note: To properly support this feature, we've changed the display of variable type names in the debugger to a shortened form. The full type name can be viewed by hovering over the name with the mouse.
* New configuration option to enable [stepping into properties and operators](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/release/debugger.md#stepping-into-properties-and-operators).
* Duplicate warnings and errors should no longer accumulate in Unity projects [#447](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/447)

## 1.2.0 (June 29, 2016)

* Adds debugger support for new Linux versions: Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora 23, openSUSE 13.2, and Oracle Linux 7.1
* Enhanced debug console output: module loads are now output, and there are launch.json options for controlling what is output
* Source file checksum support for breakpoints. This ensures that the debugger only sets breakpoints in code that exactly matches the open document.
* Support for editing the value of variables in the watch and locals window (requires VS Code 1.3)
