The extension supports remote debugging netcoreapp 2.1 or newer on `linux-arm`. The extension has been tested against **`Raspbian 8 and 9`**. Please let us know if you run into issues with other distributions.

As of netcoreapp 3.0, `linux-arm64` is also supported. When following these instructions for arm64, be sure to replace `linux-arm` with `linux-arm64`.

If you run into any problems, please file an [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp) and note in the text that this is related to `linux-arm`.

Choose **one** of the following deployment methods:

* [Framework Dependent Deployment](#framework-dependent-deployment): Compile the application locally. Deploy the binary to `linux-arm`. **Requires the .NET Core Runtime to be installed on `linux-arm`.**

* [Self Contained Deployment](#self-contained-deployment): Compile and publish the application locally. Deploy the standalone application to `linux-arm`.

# Prerequisites

## Install .NET Core 2.1 (or newer) SDK locally (IDE computer)
See [microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started-with-dotnet-tutorial) for links to the SDK and instructions.

## Install the debugger for `linux-arm` (target computer)
* Install the [native dependencies of .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x). On Raspbian, this should only mean installing Curl and unzip if it they aren't already installed (`sudo apt-get install curl`).
* Run the following command on `linux-arm` *(installs to ~/vsdbg)*:
```
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/getvsdbgsh | bash /dev/stdin -r linux-arm -v latest -l ~/vsdbg
```

# Framework-Dependent Deployment
Framework-dependent deployments are when the application is deployed without a copy of .NET Core itself, so the application depends on the shared .NET Core Framework being installed. See [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/) for more information.

## Install prerequisites
* [General prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* On the target computer, install a `linux-arm` build of the .NET Core runtime. As of this editing the latest 2.1 version can be found at https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/Runtime/2.1.3/dotnet-runtime-2.1.3-linux-arm.tar.gz. See the [arm docker file](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/2.1/runtime/stretch-slim/arm32v7/Dockerfile) to find the latest version number.

    *Example (installs to ~/dotnet):*
    ```
    mkdir ~/dotnet & curl -sSL https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/Runtime/2.1.3/dotnet-runtime-2.1.3-linux-arm.tar.gz |
    tar xvzf /dev/stdin -C ~/dotnet
    ```

## Create a new console project
On the IDE computer:
* Run `dotnet new console -n MyConsoleApp`. This will create a new netcoreapp console application called `MyConsoleApp`.

## Build and Deploy
On the IDE computer:
* In your application's root folder, run `dotnet publish`
* Copy all the files under `bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish` to your `linux-arm` device (replace '2.1' with whatever framework you are targeting).
    * To test run your application, on `linux-arm`, run the entrypoint `MyConsoleApp.dll` with `dotnet`.
        ```bash
        $ ~/dotnet/dotnet MyConsoleApp.dll
        ```

## Remotely debug your application
Reference the sample `launch.json` below.
* The `"program"` field is set to the `dotnet` executable and the first `"args"` item is the  application `.dll` relative to the current working directory (`"cwd"`) on `linux-arm`.
* Update the fields under `"pipeArgs"` to include the IP address of the `linux-arm` device and the ssh keyfile.
* The `"debuggerPath"` points to the location where you installed the debugger to on `linux-arm`.

### Sample `launch.json` - macOS and Linux
```json
    {
        "name": ".NET Core Remote Launch - Framework Dependent (console)",
        "type": "coreclr",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "~/dotnet/dotnet",
        "args": [
            "./MyConsoleApp.dll"
        ],
        "cwd": "~/MyConsoleApp",
        "stopAtEntry": false,
        "console": "internalConsole",
        "pipeTransport": {
            "pipeCwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "pipeProgram": "/usr/bin/ssh",
            "pipeArgs": [
                "-T", "-i", "mysshkeyfile",
                "pi@10.10.10.10"
            ],
            "debuggerPath": "~/vsdbg/vsdbg"
            }
    }
```

### Sample `launch.json` - Windows

This launch.json requires that [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) is installed. You must convert your ssh keyfile to a format that PuTTY understands with puttygen. See [How to convert SSH keypairs generated using PuttyGen(Windows) into key-pairs used by ssh-agent and KeyChain(Linux)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2224066/how-to-convert-ssh-keypairs-generated-using-puttygenwindows-into-key-pairs-use) for tips.

``` json
 {
            "name": ".NET Core Remote Launch - Framework Dependent (console)",
            "type": "coreclr",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "~/dotnet/dotnet",
            "args": ["./dotnetapp.dll"],
            "cwd": "~/dotnet-core-app",
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "console": "internalConsole",
            "pipeTransport": {
                "pipeCwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
                "pipeProgram": "c:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\plink.exe",
                "pipeArgs": [
                    "-i",
                    "mysshkeyfile.ppk",
                    "pi@10.10.10.10"
                ],
                "debuggerPath": "~/vsdbg/vsdbg"
            }
        }
```

It is likely that other tools than PuTTY can be used. They have not been tested.

We are researching if WSL (ssh) can be used to avoid needing to install PuTTY (or similar tool).

# Self-Contained Deployment
Self-contained deployments are when all of an applications' dependencies are carried with the deployment. So the only thing that must be installed on the target computer is the [native dependencies of .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x). See [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/) for more information.

## Install prerequisites
* [General prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Create a new console project
On the IDE computer:
* Run `dotnet new console -n MyConsoleApp`. This will create a new netcoreapp console application called `MyConsoleApp`.

## Build and Deploy
On the IDE computer:
* Run `dotnet publish -r linux-arm`
* Copy all the files under `bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/linux-arm/publish/` to `linux-arm` (replace '2.1' with whatever framework you are targeting).
* Test your application by running the standalone executable `MyConsoleApp`.
    ```bash
    $ ./MyConsoleApp
    ```

## Remotely debug your standalone application executable
Reference the sample `launch.json` below.
* The `"program"` field is the standalone executable relative to the current working directory (`"cwd"`) on `linux-arm`.
* Update the fields under `"pipeArgs"` to include the IP address of the `linux-arm` device and the ssh keyfile.
* The `"debuggerPath"` points to the location where you installed the debugger to on `linux-arm`.
