Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This preview provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono and Desktop CLR debugging is not supported.
* Support for project.json projects on Windows, macOS and Linux, and csproj projects on Windows.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

### What's New in 1.3

* Support for Unity and Mono development on macOS and Linux has been restored! This release brings back support for the Mono version of OmniSharp, which is used to provide *much* better support for .csproj/.sln projects. Please note that Mono version 4.0.1 or newer is required.
* Generation of tasks.json and launch.json files can now properly handle nested projects. [#170](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/170)
* New UI that makes it easy to select a process ID when attaching the debugger to another process. Note: If you have an existing launch.json file, you can re-generate it by deleting the file, closing your workspace in Visual Studio Code and opening it again. Or, you can open the launch.json file and change the `processId` value to `"${command.pickProcess}"`.
* Support for debugging in .cshtml files. To enable this, add a `sourceFileMap` entry to your launch.json with the following content: `"sourceFileMap": { "/Views": "${workspaceRoot}/Views" }`
* Support for conditional breakpoints
* New configuration option to enable [stepping into properties and operators](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/release/debugger.md#stepping-into-properties-and-operators).
* Duplicate warnings and errors should no longer accumulate in Unity projects [#447](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/447)
