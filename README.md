Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has [limited support](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework).
* Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

### Get Started Writing C# in VS Code

* [Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp)
* [Video Tutorial compiling with .NET Core](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-VSCode-Csharp-NET-Core-Windows)

### What's new in 1.21.2

* Added a `omnisharp.enableEditorConfigSupport` setting to enable support for .editorconfig.
* Modified the auto generated tasks in tasks.json to generate full paths and disable summary to fix the problem of no source links in the problems panel.
* Improved analyzers performance by introducing background analysis support 
* End of support for .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 (`project.json`-based .NET Core flavors).
* Added support for *AdditionalFiles* in csproj files
* Improved the MSBuild selection logic. The standalone instance inside OmniSharp is now preferred over VS2017, with VS2019 given the highest priority.

See our [change log](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/v1.21.2/CHANGELOG.md) for more detail.

### Supported Operating Systems for Debugging

* Currently, the C# debugger officially supports the following operating systems:

  * X64 operating systems:
    * Windows 7 SP1 and newer
    * macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and newer
    * Linux: see [.NET Core documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2-supported-os.md#linux) for the list of supported distributions. Note that other Linux distributions will likely work as well as long as they include glibc and OpenSSL.
  * ARM operating systems:
    * Linux is supported as a remote debugging target
