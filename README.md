## C# for Visual Studio Code
A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) that provides rich language support for C# and is shipped along with [C# Dev Kit][csdevkitextension]. Powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server, this extension integrates with open source components like [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) and [Razor](https://github.com/dotnet/razor) to provide rich type information and a faster, more reliable C# experience.

## Recommended Install
While it is possible to use the C# extension as a standalone extension, we highly recommend using [C# Dev Kit][csdevkitextension].

1. Installing [C# Dev Kit][csdevkitextension] will automatically install this extension as a required dependency.
2. Open a folder/workspace that contains a C# project (.csproj) and a C# solution (.sln) and the extension will activate.
3. Whether you install C# Dev Kit or just the C# extension, the [.NET Install Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime) will be installed as a dependency.

Note: If working on a solution that requires versions prior to .NET 6 or non-solution based projects, install a .NET Framework runtime and [MSBuild tooling](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022).
  * Set omnisharp.useModernNet to false and set dotnet.server.useOmnisharp to true
  * Uninstall or disable C# Dev Kit
  * Windows: .NET Framework along with [MSBuild Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
  * MacOS/Linux: [Mono with MSBuild](https://www.mono-project.com/download/preview/)

## How to use OmniSharp?
If you don‚Äôt want to take advantage of the great Language Server features, you can revert back to using OmniSharp by going to the Extension settings and setting `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp` to true. Next, uninstall or disable C# Dev Kit. Finally, restart VS Code for this to take effect.
